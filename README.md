# Face Detection with OpenCV

🚀 **Face Detection using OpenCV** is a real-time face detection system built using Python and OpenCV. The system uses a webcam to capture video and detects faces using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier.

## Features

- 🎥 Real-time face detection using the webcam.
- 🖼️ Detects and highlights human faces with a red rectangle.
- 💻 Built with Python and OpenCV.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed and the following Python libraries:

- **OpenCV**: For computer vision tasks like face detection.
- **Python**: The programming language for this project.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
